# User Flag
- sudo nano etc/hosts → bnn.thm
Checked the page source code and got first clue in a comment;  “Have you ever heard of steganography”
    - Was then able to get image from ip using, ip/brooklyn99.jpg and saved image
    - ran ‘strings -n 6 brooklyn99.jpg’ found encoded strings, didn't help (encrypted)
- Decided to check the ports using; nmap bnn.thm -T5 -v
	- 21/tcp open ftp
	- 22/tcp open ssh
	- 80/tcp open hhtp
        - First attempted to connect to ftp server, using name ‘user’
        - response says FTP server is anonymous only
        - reattempt to connect to FTP server as anonymous with password ‘Password’
        - login was successful, ls in FTP server, txt file found ‘note_to_jake.txt’
        - exit from ftp
- cat note, ‘Jake please change your password. It is too weak and Holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine.’
	- Now had 3 potential users; jake, amy, holt
- Try to brute force the password for user 'jake' on the ssh port (22/tcp)
    - used hydra; hydra -l jack -P mywordlist
    - Turns out brute forcing ssh configurations is very slow
    - eventually worked, password: 987654321
- logged in to jake, did not see any files or directories
- however was able to cd .. to get into amy and holt
    - amy had nothing, holt had two files ‘user.txt’ and ‘nano.save’
    - user.txt was the first flag (ee11cbb19052e40b07aac0ca060c23ee)
# Root Flag
- next had to get info out of image, used stegcracker with my wordlist to crack passphrase which game me access to a note.txt which included Holt’s password
    - stegcracker brooklyn99.jpg with wordlist
- log in to holt, ran sudo -l to see privileges, /bin/nano
- couldn’t figure it out so su to jake, ran sudo -l and found usr/bins/less
    - Found a command on [link](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/less/#sudo) that escalated privileges to root
        -   sudo less /etc/profile
            !/bin/sh
    - This gave me root
    - Ran cat /root/root.txt to get second flag (63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845)

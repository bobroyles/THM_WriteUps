## Basic Enumeration
    - Connect to machine 
        - pen.thm
    - run nmap to see open ports
        - nmap ip -T5 -sV -v
            - 22/tcp OpenSSH 
            - 80/tcp Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
            - 139/tcp Samba smbd
            - 445/tcp Samba smbd
    - look for any hidden directories using gobuster next
            - /development (Status: 301)
        - /development led to two txt files
        - One mentioned SMB configuration and Apache
        - Other file metioned a weak password with a hash that could be cracked easily found when auditing /etc/shadow
        - Decided to use enum4linux to enumerate SMB share, found two usernames: kay and jan 
            - also found a sharename: IPC$
            - .txt file mentioned a 'J' having a weak password
        - was able to use smbclient and an anonymous user to access the smb share which contained a 'staff.txt'
            - staff.txt contained both user names
        - Decided to brute force the ssh password for jan using hydra because of the supposed weak password
            - Eventually returned password: armando
# Privelege Escalation
    - Found the private key for kay in the .ssh directory
    - Copied private key onto my machine and used ssh2john to convert the private key into a hash
    - used john to brute force the hash and find the password
        - beeswax    (kay_privatekey)
    - Then was able to get final flag in pass.bak 
        - cat pass.bak
            - heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
